# Privacy policy

## What data is collected

Kausi receives your email address and password when you sign up for or sign in to the site. They are not stored by Kausi, but are passed on to the [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) authentication system.

Similarly, whenever you create a text entry in Kausi that text is submitted to the Firebase Realtime Database, where it is stored in plain text.

## What the data is used for

Your email address and password are used to authenticate with Firebase.

If you request a password reset, Firebase will send a password reset link to your email address.

Your data is not used for anything else.

## How your data is protected

All traffic between your browser and Firebase happens on a HTTPS-secured connection.

Any Kausi administrator accounts are able to view your email address and text entries. These accounts use all the account security options Firebase offers, including a strong password stored in secure password manager software.

## How cookies and localstorage are used

Firebase uses localstorage to temporarily store data related to authentication. Kausi itself does not use any cookies or localstorage.

## Data disclosure to third parties

Your data is stored in Firebase and is therefore subject to their policies. Kausi does not disclose your data to any other party for any other reason.

## Your consent

By using Kausi, you consent to this privacy policy.

## Changes to this policy

If this privacy policy changes, we will post the changes on this page, send an email notifying you of any changes, and/or update the Privacy Policy modification date below.

This registry is used for handling authentication and account management in Kausi.

The data saved to this registry contains the user's email address (retrieved via the user's input), a unique identifier, a password, the textual entries they input into Kausi, and other miscellaneous pieces of data related to user authentication.

The data resides in Firebase, in the United States. Firebase is owned by Google and their terms of service can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/terms/).

Every user has the right to inspect and remove their data, as well as request corrections to their data. Users can contact hello@vuoro.design for assistance with inspecting or removing their data.

Other than Firebase, no third party has access to the data. Kausi will not use the data for any purposes other than user authentication and customer support.
